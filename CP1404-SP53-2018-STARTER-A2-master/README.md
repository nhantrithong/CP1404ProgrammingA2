# CP1404/5632 Assignment: Songs To Learn by YOURNAME

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own assignment details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get full marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It took me a total of 3 days to accomplish whatever i can for the project as in the end i wasn't able to completely
finish it properly. the overall project itself was extremely difficult and i did not manage enough of my own time to 
invest in it properly enough to deliver it with the best quality. And apart of me feel like even though class material 
did cover the basics about the project, it certainly did not expand on it enough or gave enough practice for me to be able to
do this project at all.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am most satisfied with the fact that i was still able to get some of the main functionalities required in the project instructions
to work despite how difficult and exhausting it was for me initially when i began working on it. in the beginning, i could
not make any progress at all as i was completely taken back by how much more difficult the project was in comparison
to the same material that was already taught in class, thus i had to try really hard to work on it and understand it and i was
quite but not extremely satisfied with what i managed to produce in the end.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am least satisfied with my understanding of the material and therefore the overall project as a whole before, during
and after its "completiton". it was extremely difficult for me and i was not happy with my level of understanding towards
the material needed to do the project. the project itself encompassed what was taught in class but it is on too high of 
a level in my opinion for me to be able to ultilize all i learnt. therefore i am not too satisfied with how my project
turnt out as i feel like if only i understood not just the material but what the project requires and how to code certain things
better, i could have done a much better job. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Even though the project proved to be extremely difficult for me, i am satisfied with how i developed through out the whole
ordeal/process. I was able to learn alot of new things that i did not know about prior before doing the project, and some 
of it frustrates me as i felt like it was not covered or focused enough about in class for me to be able to apply it
to the highest extent to the project itself. but overall i am satisfied with the new things i was able to learn from this experiene

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Next time i would ensure that i gave myself more time not only to do the project but to ask questions from my lecturer
as well as during this project my time was severely limitted which ended up limitting my time to ask questions as a whole. 
I would also improve by going back to the topics in class which the project mainly encompasses and try to revise it as much as
i can and ask questions when appropriate so that i can have a better understanding on all the topics and material requried to go into the project.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
my only real resources were my lecturer and friends whom i compared my code to often when we meet so that we can improve
upon our own code with the other person's suggestions. but that was not what i did mainly as my main resource was my lecturer,
i spend a large amount of time asking as much questions as i can towards the lecturer regarding the project and tried to
get as much feedback as i could to improve on my project. however, time with my lecturer for questions was heavily limitted
so it was quite difficult for me to ask as much questions as i wanted or could.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
My main and biggest challenge for this project is going in it practically blind as the knowledge and material required
for it was way too advanced compared to what was covered in class in my opinion. but it was kind of thanks to this project that
i was able to face this new challenge head on and i was able to learn alot of new things along the way. It was extremely 
frustrating alot of the time as i found alot of the parts within the project extremely difficult and hard to understand,
and even though i managed to produce what i consider the bare minimum product for the project at the end, i wouldn't say i 
have overcame the challenge, but i certainly faced it head on and came out not too bad but not too good either.
